    "⚠️: Prepare a venv that use python 3.11.  `python -m venv .venv` might be the most intuitive approach. Then just run `source .venv/bin/activate`. After that, run the following command. Also, make sure `npm` and `nodejs` are installed locally. You can check whether they have been installed by using `node -v` and `npm -v`. If not installed, please installed it before running any code block in this notebook.\n"
